# Contributing to Aya

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Aya. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Asking questions

Have a question? Rather than opening an issue, please ask away on [@7room](https://twitter.com/7room) or just send us an [email](mailto:mailbox@7room.net).

## Reporting bugs and feature requests

Have you identified a reproducible problem in Aya? Have a feature request? We want to know about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

> Bugs and feature requests are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

### Look for an existing issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/7room/aya/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

Be sure to scan through the [most popular](https://github.com/7room/aya/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* 👍 - upvote
* 👎 - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue.

### Create a new issue

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help us reproduce the problem.
The more information you can provide, the more likely we will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, record the GIF with the [Keybinding Resolver](https://github.com/atom/keybinding-resolver) shown. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on Windows.

> The built-in tool for reporting an issue, which you can access by using `Report a problem` or `Provide a suggestion` in Aya's 'More' menu, can help streamline this process by automatically providing the version, log file contents, and your system info. Additionally, the tool will search among existing issues to see if a similar issue already exists.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Aya version

* Aya log and settings files

* Your operating system  

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

* Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!
Thank you for taking the time to contribute.
